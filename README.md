# WORD: Revisiting Organs Segmentation in the Whole Abdominal Region ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HcRo3WARRXa_iBdFpo_4Z2s3z7PMzLlL/view?usp=sharing)]).
* This repository provides the codebase and dataset for our work **[WORD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.02403.pdf): Revisiting Organs Segmentation in the Whole Abdominal Region**. 
* Now, we are preparing an online evaluation server for the fair and open research if you have experience with it or want to join or provide some support to this project, please contact us !!!
* Some information about the **WORD** dataset is  presented in the following:

<div align=center>Fig. 3.  User study based on three junior oncologists independently, each of them comes from a different hospital.<img src="./figures/user.png"></div>

# Dataset
The **WORD** dataset will be released once the work is accepted (150 volumes with 16 carefully annotated organs), moreover, the dataset will be extended to larger and more diverse (more patients, more organs, and more modalities, more clinical hospitals' data and MR Images will be considered to include future). Any questions, please contact [Xiangde](https://luoxd1996.github.io/).
