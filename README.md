# DataSet
Please contact Xiangde Luo (luoxd1996 AT gmail DOT com) for the dataset. Two steps are needed to download and fully access the dataset: **1) using your google email to apply for the download permission**; **2) using your affiliation email to get the unzip password**. We will get back to you after the paper is accepted. We just handle the **real-name email** and **your email suffix must match your affiliation**. The email should contain the following information:

    Name/Homepage/Google Scholar: (Tell us who you are.)
    Primary Affiliation: (The name of your institution or university, etc.)
    Job Title: (E.g., Professor, Associate Professor, Ph.D., etc.)
    Affiliation Email: (the password will be sent to this email, we just reply to the email which is the end of "edu".)
    How to use: (Only for academic research, not for commercial use or second-development.)
    
In addition, this work is still ongoing, the **WORD** dataset will be extended to larger and more diverse (more patients, more organs, and more modalities, more clinical hospitals' data and MR Images will be considered to include future), any **suggestion**, **comment**, **collaboration**, and **sponsor** are welcome.
